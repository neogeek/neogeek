I'm a **game**, **web**, and **open source tool** developer.

I've released **150+ open source projects** on [GitHub](https://github.com/neogeek), I've won awards for üèÜ Best in VR and üèÜ Best of Accessibility at the 2020 [MIT Reality Hack](https://www.mitrealityhack.com), I run the [Purple Monkey Game Jam](https://purplemonkeygamejam.com/), given talks at [Boston Game Dev](https://www.meetup.com/bostongamedev/) meetups, and I just released my first game for mobile platforms called üÉè [Flip Jacks](https://flipjacksgame.com).
