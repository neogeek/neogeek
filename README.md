## Hi! 👋 My name is Scott.

I'm a **game**, **web**, and **open source tool** developer.

I've released **150+ open source projects** on [GitHub](https://github.com/neogeek), I'm close to publishing my first game 🃏 [Flip Jacks](https://flipjacksgame.com), I've won two awards for 🏆 **Best in VR** and 🏆 **Best of Accessibility** at the 2020 [MIT Reality Hack](https://www.mitrealityhack.com), and I run the 🐵 [Purple Monkey Game Jam](https://purplemonkeygamejam.com/).

I'm currently focused on wrapping up [Flip Jacks](https://flipjacksgame.com), but I'm also working on a bunch of other projects. Here is a list of the projects that have been built or updated in the last year.

[Demo](https://neogeek.dev/sketchpad/)

Using the packages detailed above, I've started to build out an online drawing game. In the process of developing this untitled game, I've released a package for drawing SVGs on either the desktop or mobile devices. The final project of this application will use the [websocket-game-lobby](https://github.com/neogeek/websocket-game-lobby), [websocket-game-lobby-client-hooks](https://github.com/neogeek/websocket-game-lobby-client-hooks) and the soon to be released Unity package.

### Unity Development

In addition to CandyCoded, I also maintain a lot of tools for simplifying certain aspects of Unity development.

### Top Down

[topdown.app](https://topdown.app)

I love Trello, but I've found managing a number of boards can result in lost tasks. To simplify this process, I made a Trello board aggregator called Top Down. Top Down is a read-only aggregate of lists in all of your starred boards. It is free to use and doesn't store any data at all.

- 👷‍♂️ [topdown](https://github.com/neogeek/topdown)

### Slack Bots

When Slack first opened up the platform to development, I immediately started to create content for it. Recently, I decided to go back and rebuild those projects to work with more recent technology.

- 🔥 [giffany](https://github.com/neogeek/giffany) - This Slack bot works similar to Giphy as you can search for gifs, preview, randomize and then post those gifs.
- 🔥 [slash commands](https://github.com/neogeek/cloudflare-workers) - This random assortment of slash commands has been completely rebuilt and deployed on the Cloudflare Worker Function platform.

### Custom Webpack App
